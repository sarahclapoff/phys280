Order of operations for working on dwave things:
1. do it on jupyter notebook (a6.ipynb)
2.download jupyter notebook as python code (a6.py)
3. update those both to github (i guess?)
4. open the PYTHON doc in dwave (add https://ide.dwavesys.io/# to the front of doc in github)
5. Run in dwave IDE (through terminal)
6. if you make any changes in IDE, you have to push the new copy in the IDE
7. THEN redownload to work on it in jupyter notebook again??

this seems so stupid but i don't know the easy way and I just want to start working on this assignment :(
