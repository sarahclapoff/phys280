# phys280

Order of operations for working on dwave things:
1. do it on jupyter notebook (a6.ipynb)
2. download jupyter notebook as python code (a6.py)
3. NOTE: all files have been saved in my local phys280 repo
THEN in dwave Leap IDE:
4. pull changes from github
5. Run in dwave IDE (through terminal)
6. if you make any changes in IDE, you have to push the new copy in the IDE
7. NOW since everything is in the repo you shouldnt have to redownload and reupload everything everytime you want to test?

I think just having to download the python file sucks, but it's still stupid :(
